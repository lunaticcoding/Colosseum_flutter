# Mana

This app allows you to play your favourite arcade games (space invaders, pacman, ...) while you are exercising. The finished app will allow the user to do several exercises including, but not limited to push-ups and squats.

# Current status
This repository is stale. I am currently reimplementing this project natively due to performance issues. Also I am working on a custom face detection using various MobileNet Architectures.
